<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Problem Statement

<h4>
<ul>

<li>X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google.</li>
<li>Once these people land on the websites, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals.</li>
<li>Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%.</li>

</ul>

## Business Objectives

<h4>
<ul>

<li>To help X education to select the most promising leads known as ‘hot leads’ who are most likely to convert into paid customers.</li>
<li>Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads where the leads with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the leads with lower lead score have lower conversion chance.</li>
<li>Identify the outliers, if any in the dataset and justify the same</li>
<li>Consider both technical and business aspects while building the model.</li>
<li>Identify the driver variables and understand their significance which are strong indicators of lead conversion.</li>
<li>Summarize the conversion predictions by using evaluation metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision.</li>
</ul>
